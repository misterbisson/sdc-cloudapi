Title: CreateMachineSnapshot (POST /:login/machines/:id/snapshots)
â€”
Text:

Allows you to take a snapshot of a machine.  Once you have one or more
snapshots, you can boot the machine from a previous snapshot.

Snapshots are not usable with other machines; they are a point in time snapshot
of the current machine. Snapshots can also only be taken of  machines that are
of type 'smartmachine'.

Since SmartMachines use a copy-on-write filesystem, snapshots take up increasing
amounts of space as the filesystem changes over time. There is a limit to how
much space snapshots are allowed to take. Plan your snapshots accordingly.

You can poll on [GetMachineSnapshot](#GetMachineSnapshot) until the `state` is
`success`.

### Inputs

||name||String||The name to assign to the new snapshot||

### Returns

||name||String||The name of this snapshot||
||state||String||The current state of the snapshot||

### Errors

For all possible errors, see [CloudAPI HTTP Responses](#cloudapi-http-responses).

||**Error Code**||**Description**||
||ResourceNotFound||If `:login` or `:id` does not exist||
||InvalidArgument||If `name` was invalid||
