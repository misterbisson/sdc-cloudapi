Title: Appendix B: Cloud Analytics

Text:


Cloud Analytics (CA) provides deep observability for systems and applications in
a SmartDataCenter cloud.  The CA service enables you to dynamically instrument
systems in the cloud to collect performance data that can be visualized in
real-time (through the portal), or collected using the API and analyzed later by
custom tools.  This data can be collected and saved indefinitely for capacity
planning and other historical analysis.
